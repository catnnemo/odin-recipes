This is the readme for the Odin Project **Odin-Recipes**. 
This is my first project, Recipes. 

Many of the HTML topics I've already learned like basic tags. 

Some of the things I've encountered for the first time is using **Git**, **GitHub**, **using bash** in Linux to manage files, and the basics of **version control**. I didn't know anything about version control until this course; it's honestly fascinating. It's one of those things that "you don't know what you don't know". 

I'm very interested to see the power of git in more and more complex projects.

Until later,
